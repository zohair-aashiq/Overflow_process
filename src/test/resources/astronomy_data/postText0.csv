5826454557829809726|How can I collimate a dobsonian telescope with a laser collimator?|"I've had a dobsonian telescope for a while now, but I've never been able to collimate it. I thought I had it collimated once, but when I looked through it the star didn't look right, it looked kind of like a round disc with a hole in the middle. I know the basic idea behind doing it with a laser collimator, you need to get the laser to line up with the center of the primary mirror as well as line up in the center of the target on the laser itself. However, I always have a lot of difficult accomplishing this. For starters, I always have a lot of trouble getting the secondary mirror lined up. I'll get really close, but once I get close I have a lot of trouble doing the fine tuning to get the laser in the middle. I'll get it in, but when I got to tighten the other screws it will no longer be lined up. I'll try to account for the tightening as well, but it's always a guessing game for me when it comes to knowing which screws to loosen and tighten so that the laser winds up where I want. I don't have that many problems with the primary mirror, and can normally get that lined up fairly easily. However, usually after lining up the primary mirror the secondary mirror no longer seemed to be lined up and I need to do the secondary mirror all over again. I'm assuming this is to be expected, but considering the difficulty I have lining up the secondary mirror it's very frustrating. I've tried looking around at resources online, but none of them go into enough detail into aligning the secondary mirror. They just say ""adjust the screws until it's lined up"", which doesn't solve my problem, since I have trouble figuring out exactly which screws to adjust and when. I'm also confused as to what I should see through my telescope when it is properly aligned. Most of the sites just use a diagram, but I'm never really sure what to make of the diagram. The one time I did line it up it looked like a round disc with a hole in the middle, which I didn't think looked right. So to summarize, the main problems I have are: I have trouble fine tuning the secondary mirror, since I have trouble accounting for the movement of the mirror when tightening the two screws I didn't loosen I'm not sure what a star should look like through my telescope when it is properly collimated Can anyone offer some detailed instructions, and possibly a video, of how to collimate a dobsonian telescope with a laser collimator?"|astronomy.stackexchange.com

The problem is mechanics for such rigs is rather complex, expensive and not entirely within reach of an amateur.

Use intervalometer in the camera firmware to take multiple photos of moderately long exposure, short enough that the stars don't blur into lines. Save each as RAW so that the trace amounts of light captured in each of them don't get lost. Either using more bright stars as markers, or even calculating the misalignment of the photos basing on movement of the sky and lens geometry composite the images in software, to obtain good images of the night sky.

6503921135520270146|How could a hobbyist astronomer determine apparent magnitude of a star?|Apparent magnitude is a rather complex way to determine the brightness of a star. Quoting the introduction text from the linked to Wikipedia page: The apparent magnitude (m) of a celestial body is a measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth, adjusted to the value it would have in the absence of the atmosphere. The brighter the object appears, the lower the value of its magnitude. Generally the visible spectrum (vmag) is used as a basis for the apparent magnitude, but other regions of the spectrum, such as the near-infrared J-band, are also used. In the visible spectrum Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky, whereas in the near-infrared J-band, Betelgeuse is the brightest. While it is of course a useful measure also for the slightly more casual, non-scientific observer to help determine the observed star from its neighboring cluster, or identification in general, I always wondered if there is a way to measure apparent magnitude with enthusiast-class equipment, and what would these procedures be?                                                              Apparent magnitude scale and observational limits (Source: ESA Science) Also interesting would be a description of what level of precision and enthusiast can get with such equipment while measuring apparent magnitude of a distant star.

So, these planets are gas giants and are very hot (hence their category). However, a few discoveries have lead to questioning about what is the fate of these planets. example 1: HD 209458b a.k.a. ""Osiris"" According to the NASA page ""Dying Planet Leaks Carbon-Oxygen"", Osiris is doing more than 'evaporating', it is leaking carbon, oxygen alongside hydrogen in an envelope behind the planet that has been detected from Earth. The significance of carbon and oxygen is stated from the article: Although carbon and oxygen have been observed on Jupiter and Saturn, it is always in combined form as methane and water deep in the atmosphere. In HD 209458b the chemicals are broken down into the basic elements. But on Jupiter or Saturn, even as elements, they would still remain invisible low in the atmosphere. The fact that they are visible in the upper atmosphere of HD 209458b confirms that atmospheric 'blow off' is occurring. It is stated in the article that Osiris is likely to become a hypothesised class of exoplanet known as a Chthonian, which is defined in ""Evaporation rate of hot Jupiters and formation of Chthonian planets"" (Hebard et al. 2003) as new class of planets made of the residual central core of former hot Jupiters These would be similar in size to Earth, but considerably denser. example 2: CoRoT-7b According to the NASA article ""Most Earthlike Exoplanet Started out as Gas Giant"", CoRoT-7b is an Earth-sized planet where a hot Jupiter usually is found, they describe it as is almost 60 times closer to its star than Earth, so the star appears almost 360 times larger than the sun does in our sky,"" Jackson said. As a consequence, the planet's surface experiences extreme heating that may reach 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit on the daylight side. CoRoT-7b's size (70 percent larger than Earth) and mass (4.8 times Earth's) indicate that the world is probably made of rocky materials. The high day time temperature means that the star-facing side of the planet is likely to be molten, any tenuous atmosphere is also blasted away. Scientists estimate that many Earth-masses may have been boiled off. It also seems that the decreasing mass is causing the planet to be drawn closer to the star -cause more material to be boiled off, hence the mass to decrease. To summarise on of the scientists in the article: You could say that, one way or the other, this planet is disappearing before our eyes,"" The question As these are only 2 examples of a possible process, the question is, what is the current accepted theory as to the fate of hot Jupiter exoplanets?

In essence, what is our local interstellar cloud made out of and how much of it is there:         We've had much success so far in isolating distant radio wave sources and analyzing their hyperfine, i.e. molecular level composition. Same goes even for interstellar medium composition down to molecular ions of diazenylium (N2H+) that is surrogate to the presence of unobservable, nonpolar N2. For example, P. Caselli et al. from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics presented a paper (PDF) on J = 1 → 0 transition of N2H+ at 93 GHz toward the quiescent low-mass cloud core L1512 in Taurus, back in 1995. That is 18 years ago! What I don't understand is, what's preventing us, with current technology, from isolating local low-mass formations in the radio wave spectra from its background noise and analyzing its hyperfine structure through radio-astronomical spectrometry? Is the signal to noise ratio simply unworkable and the density of the local cloud too thin to filter it out from its background?

3202520700785132651|Determining effect of small variable force on planetary perihelion precession|Is there an analytical technique for determining the effect of a small variable transverse acceleration upon the rate of aspides precession (strictly not a precession but rotation of the line of aspides) of a planet orbitting around the Sun in a 2D plane according to Newtonian gravity law? I have modelled such effects in a reiterative computer model and would like to verify those measurements. The transverse acceleration formula is $$At = (K/c^2)*Vr*Vt * Ar.$$ Where:- c is speed of light, K is a constant of magnitude between 0 and +/-3, such that $K/(c^2) << 1$. Ar is the acceleration of the planet towards the Sun due to Newtonian gravitational influence of the Sun, ($Ar = GM/r^2$). Vr is radial component of planet velocity relative to the Sun (+ = motion away from the Sun) Vt is transverse component of planet velocity relative to the Sun (+ = direction of planet forward motion along its orbital path). Vectorially Vt = V - Vr where V is the total instantaneous velocity vector of the planet relative to the Sun. Assume planet mass is small relative to the Sun No other bodies are in the system All motions and accelerations are confined to the two-dimensional plane of the orbit. UPDATE The reason why this is interesting to me is that a value of K = +3 in my computer model produces anomalous (Non-Newtonian) periapse rotation rate values very close within about 1% of those predicted by General Relativity and within a few percent of those observed by astronomers (Le Verrier, updated by Newcomb). Formula (Einstein, 1915) for GR-derived periapse rotation (radians per orbit) from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsidal_precession $$ \boldsymbol{\omega}=24.\pi^3.a^2.T^{-2}.c^{-2}.(1-e^2)^{-1} $$ UPDATE 4 I have accepted Walter's answer. Not only did he answer the original question (Is there a technique...?) but also his analysis produces a formula which not only confirms the computer-simulated effects of the transverse acceleration formula (for K = 3) but which also (unexpectedly to me) is essentially equivalent to the Einstein 1915 formula. from Walter's Summary (in Walter's answer below):- : (from first order peturbation analysis) semi-major axis and eccentricity are unchanged, but the direction of periapse rotates in the plane of the orbit at rate $$ \omega=\Omega \frac{v_c^2}{c^2} \frac{K}{1-e^2}, $$ where $\Omega$ is the orbital frequency and $v_c=\Omega a$ with $a$ the semi-major axis. Note that (for $K=3$) this agrees with the general relativity (GR) precession rate at order $v_c^2/c^2$ (given by Einstein 1915).|astronomy.stackexchange.com

As such, these bodies preserve information about collisional breakup, the dominant physical process that has shaped the present asteroid belt.

Further information is found in the scientists' research paper Persistent Evidence of a Jovian Mass Solar Companion in the Oort Cloud (Matese and Whitmire, 2010), describe the hypothesised planet to be of mass 1 − 4 M(Jupiter) orbiting in the innermost region of the outer Oort cloud.

(...) Neutron stars have overall densities of 3.7×10^17 to 5.9×10^17 kg/m^3 [1] and You can use the Schwarzschild radius to calculate the ""density"" of the black hole - i.e., the mass divided by the volume enclosed within the Schwarzschild radius. This is roughly equal to (1.8x10^16 g/cm^3) x (Msun / M)^2 (...) The value of the Schwarzschild radius works out to be about (3x10^5 cm) x (M / Msun) [2] Let's take a neutron star from the top of the spectrum (3.2 Msun) and same mass black hole. Converting units: Neutron star: 5.9×10^17 kg/m^3 = 5.9 × 10^14 g/cm^3 Black hole: 1.8x10^16 g/cm^3 x (1/5.9)^2 = 5.2 x10^14 g/cm^3 The radius of the black hole would be (3x10^5 cm) x ( 5.2 ) = 15.6km The 3.2Msun Neutron Star of this density would have volume of 1.08 x 10^13 m^3 which gives radius of 13.7 kilometers According to Shell Theorem, spherical objects' gravity field strength at given distance is the same for spheres as for point masses so at the same distance from center of same mass (point - black hole, sphere - neutron star) the gravity will be the same.

Instead, they are powered by gravitational energy released as the stars contract, while moving towards the main sequence, which they reach after about 100 million years. The mentioned 100 million years is the period of the star being in its stable (well, as stable as the turbulent T Tauri type stars get) state without nuclear fusion. Then, once the fusion starts, we get between 3 million and hundreds of billions years of main sequence, depending on mass of the resulting star. What I'm interested is how long is the period of transition between the two - ignition of the nuclear reaction - time between ""all energy produced by gravitational contraction"" and ""most of energy produced by nuclear fusion"". I imagine this period could be quite short, and the effect quite rapid and turbulent as the initial fusion increases local temperature (and as result pressure) drastically, leading to conditions conductive for fusion spreading rapidly over the volume which is already on brink of entering the fusion everywhere within the protostar, essentially a nuclear wildfire encompassing the gathered gas, a chain reaction starting. Am I right in my guess this process is rather rapid? Was it ever observed? Or contrary, does the intensity of the fusion reaction rise gradually and slowly from zero over many millions years of star formation?"|astronomy.stackexchange.com

3301284075899438839|Two species of dark matter?|At this point in time, evidence for the existence of dark matter has accumulated in many ways: it affects galactic rotation curves plays a major role in cosmology, and the evolution of structure in the universe is predicted in copious amounts by gravitational lensing on a wide range of scales influences the dynamics of galaxy clusters to name a few. There are many known candidates for dark matter particles: WIMPs, axions, WISPs, neutrinos, etc (in fact, even bricks, though some other considerations would exclude them). The question then is: Why do we expect that only one type of dark matter particles is responsible for phenomenological dark matter? For example, $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, the standard cosmological model, requires dark matter to be cold (slow, non-relativistic), which is used to constrain the possible properties of dark matter particles. However, this doesn't actually imply, that dark matter is cold for all the astrophysical systems. For example, galactic halos could be made of warm dark matter, and halos of dwarf galaxies could be made of cold dark matter. One might of course say that one-species model is the simplest one. The counter-argument would be that in reality there well may be many species. This in turn might have profound implications for astrophysical models. To summarize the question: Is there any good reason, preferably supported by observations, to think that only one species of dark matter is present in all the models currently used?|astronomy.stackexchange.com

A source of light, say A, is directly observed in its 'true' position and some of its light is bent around the black-hole, X, which gives a second observation of A, called A'. Does gravitational lensing cause the amount of emissions (detected as coming from the (point/position/direction) of X) to far exceed anything else in that vicinity? Does this then make the 'black-hole' by far the brightest, noisiest thing to be observed? (kind of like waving & shouting in a quiet room) [edit - based on astromax's answer] I follow what is meant regarding super massive black-holes. Consider the following scenario: A suitable massive sun on dying contracts into a (small) black-hole. This black-hole will now cause a lensing-effect, but since it is small the amount of emissions so 'lensed' around it is very small and maybe too small to detect? or, it is detected but erroneously ascribed to be a type of sun or other type of emission source?|astronomy.stackexchange.com

4324947319583869830|Stars at near break-up rotation rates|Accretion discs are ubiquitous in astrophisics. As a direct corollary, they are important for the following question. Consider the following model, representing one of the most simple models for accretion discs. A central object is a star (pre-MS, WD or NS, but not a BH) of mass $M$, surrounded by a thin flat disc of material, which continuosly feeds the star at a rate $\dot{M}$, such that $M/\dot{M}$ is much larger than thermal and dynamical timescale of the star (i.e. accretion rate is slow). Everywhere in the accretion disc its local motion is nearly circular and nearly Keplerian. Therefore, at the interface of the star and the disc the disc will always tend to make the star rotate at nearly-Keplerian velocities. From the other hand, if the stellar outer parts were to rotate at nearly-Keplerian velocities, these parts would become gravitationaly detached from the star, which would have significant consequences for the stellar shape and structure. Surely, though, the process is going to be slow and the acquired angular momentum will be redistributed within the star. Now the question: What will be happening to the star if it approaches nearly break-up velocities due to such a spin-up? This involves a few subquestions: How close the rotation rate can actually get to the critical one? If it can get close enough, how would the whole process look like? That is, what would happen in the short term to the star when the effects of rotation will start to affect its structure? What would happen to the star in the long term? I would like to keep this problem as a purely hydrodynamical one. That is, assume, that the only laws involved are hydrodynamical and gravitational ones, with some constant accretion rate supported. In reality magnetic fields would also play an important role for some stars, and stellar winds could also possibly be important. Examples of the decribed systems are numerous. It might concern cataclysmic variables, millisecond pulsars, pre-main sequence star in a protoplanetary disc, and many more.|astronomy.stackexchange.com
3423831059611907221|Colossus telescope, trying to outsmart aliens?|I was listening to Jeff Kuhn's talk on SETI's Colossus telescope project. Background: He explains his theory that a civilization living somewhere the galaxy would want to hide, and thus would shortly learn to avoid broadcasting radio signals all over the galaxy, so as to avoid attracting attention (presumably to avoid inter-stellar predators). Then he comes up with a great idea; due to the second law of thermodynamics, they would have to dissipate heat-energy, and thus, one can detect them anyway, because they have no way to hide this heat-energy. This, particularly when they are a Type I civilization, and nearing Type II; in this case, to avoid global warming, they would capture and use almost all solar energy, and emit an equivalent amount heat-energy. Thus he proposes a telescope to focus on single stars, which would be capable of detecting this heat-energy (by the distinctive infrared light emmited). My question: If a civilization was smart enough to hide all of its radio signals, wouldn't they know that they cannot avoid emitting heat-energy? Thus their predators would be able to find them anyway, and thus, it is pointless to hide the radio signals? Therefore, we should already be seeing their radio signals, and this telescope is being built for a theory with some holes. Note: I am not suggesting that the telescope shouldn't be built; I think it could have other very valuable uses, and it would also be interesting to eliminate the theory if it is indeed incorrect (or prove it correct ... somehow).

7558303720329816839|Can moon set after being up when due north? (pseudo circumpolarity)|"I'm in the northern hemisphere, facing north, and notice that the moon is due north (azimuth 0) and is still above the horizon, albeit barely. Does this mean the moon is necessarily circumpolar (doesn't set), at least for the next few hours? As the moon moves away from due north, it's altitude/elevation normally increases. However, it's possible that the moon's declination is decreasing so rapidly that the moon's elevation actually decreases, and the moon sets. Is this possible? This question is tangentially related to my question ""libnova odd behavior for 89.5 degrees north latitude"" on Stack Overflow. EDIT to answer questions: I am facing true north. I am referring to the Earth's true moon, but not necessarily in any given time frame. In other words, if something like this happens 10,000 years from now, that's fine. EDIT: OK, I believe the moon CAN set even if it's up when due north. Example: You are at latitude 89.5N The moon's declination when due north is +0.5N. This means the moon grazes the horizon when due north. If the moon's declination were constant, it's highest elevation for the day would be 1 degree. Since the moon's declination can change more than one degree per day (average of 1.5 degrees/day), it's quite possible for the moon's declination to go below -0.5N, at which point it would have set (it will actually set before this point unless it happens to reach due south). In theory, this could happen with any object whose declination changes, provide you're close enough to the North Pole. I'll leave this update open for critiques. EDIT: Actually, this whole question is just asking whether the midnight sun/moon can set at any position other than due north, which is fairly obviously true. Reasoning: once the moon/sun finally sets not due north, it was obviously still up the last time it was due north."|astronomy.stackexchange.com

5334303262622627280|Is lunar elevation at a given location for a given day unimodal?|Is lunar elevation at a given location for a given day unimodal: Unimodal function In other words, once the moon's elevation reaches a minimum (which may be above or below the horizon depending on if the moon is circumpolar), does it increase continuously to its maximum, or can it decrease briefly and then increase again (resulting in a local minimum that's not a global minimum) before reaching the maximum. And also similar to the above as it goes from the maximum elevation (which may also be above or below the horizon depending on whether the moon rises at all on a given day). Why this is important: I think I found a bug in libnova that assumes the moon is circumpolar if it is above the horizon when it's due north. This is untrue My fix does not assume this, but does assume that lunar elevation is unimodal. If that's untrue, I'll need to further fix my fix. EDIT: Here's how far I've gotten: The moon's declination and hour angle (at a given location) are both functions of time. Thus, we can implicitly consider the moon's declination to be a function of its hour angle. This only works because the moon never experiences retrograde motion. Bodies that experience retrograde motion could have two declinations for a given hour angle, so the declination would no longer be a function of the hour angle. Using the standard formula, we see the moon's elevation is: $$ \sin ^{-1}(\sin (\text{lat}) \sin (\text{dec}(\text{ha}))+\cos (\text{ha}) \cos (\text{lat}) \cos (\text{dec}(\text{ha}))) $$ where dec(ha) is the declination at hour angle, ha is the hour angle, and lat is the latitude. Since the moon's elevation is a differentiable function (except potentially at the poles and equator), we find the derivative with respect to the hour angle: $$ \frac{\text{dec}'(\text{ha}) (\sin (\text{lat}) \cos (\text{dec}(\text{ha}))-\cos (\text{ha}) \cos (\text{lat}) \sin (\text{dec}(\text{ha})))-\sin (\text{ha}) \cos (\text{lat}) \cos (\text{dec}(\text{ha}))}{\sqrt{1-(\sin (\text{lat}) \sin (\text{dec}(\text{ha}))+\cos (\text{ha}) \cos (\text{lat}) \cos (\text{dec}(\text{ha})))^2}} $$ The moon's elevation will reach a min/max (in the sense of unimodality) when this derivative is 0. That occurs when: $ \sin (\text{ha})\text{ = } \text{dec}'(\text{ha}) (\tan (\text{lat})-\cos (\text{ha}) \tan (\text{dec}(\text{ha}))) $ So the question becomes: can this equation have more than two solutions for 0 < ha < 2*Pi Which I hope someone answers at: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/587136/|astronomy.stackexchange.com

1352430867411234408|How would I measure that I'm at a pole?|How would a person measure that he is at a planetary pole? My first inclination is to use a sextant to ensure that the Sun remains at a constant inclination. However, due to the orbit around the Sun and a possible planetary axial tilt, the Sun's inclination may vary over the course of the year and that could affect measurements if the length of the day is a significant portion of the length of the year. A second inclination is to try to identify a pole star or at least the point about which distant stars rotate during the course of a planetary rotation. The observer could then (at least in theory) measure the inclination of this point assuming that planetary precession takes a long enough time (as on Earth). However, in the most likely chance that there is no bright star near the pole, I don't see how a sextant could measure reliably the inclination of a blank point. Perhaps the first method could be used, but with other objects in the sky (stars) in place of the Sun. Thus, if a given star's inclination does not change as it (apparently) revolves around the horizon, we are at the pole. Are there any better methods, assuming a completely self-contained system (i.e. no external satellites)?|astronomy.stackexchange.com

6701215642117642056|Generalised planets?|"There is somewhat of an abstract way of generalising the notion of planets. Standard definition of planets is, obviously: ""planets are the objects formed from the residual material surrounding a newly formed main sequence star through a complex formation process"". Let me introduce a bit more general, by no means commonly known, definition of ""generalised planets as bound macroscopic objects formed from some former accretion process taking place near some gravitating body over many orbital periods"". Clearly, the latter definition is more general, as it doesn't specify the type of accretion event and the type of the central body. Now, for example, the accretion mechanism can be very different from that in protoplanetary discs: consider, for example, accretion on a compact object (a neutron star or a black hole), accrection on supermassive black hole, accretion from remnants of binary neutron stars merger, or any other possible accretion process. As noted in some answers, some stars also form in accretion-involving processes in the vicinity of other stars. To avoid including stars into 'generalised planet' category, the definition specifies that the objects should be formed over many orbital periods, implying that they should be sufficiently bound with respect to the primary. The question: Are there generalised planets other than planets/exoplanets?"|astronomy.stackexchange.com
118864056447993843|How well can we in principle determine $T_{\textrm{eff}}$ of a star?|"This is a question about the basics of astronomy, which I have never happened to see a good discussion for. It is about how well would we be able to measure effective temperature of a star, if we had any arbitrarily perfect measurement devices. Here is some context. Canonical definition of $T_{\textrm{eff}}$ of a star is based on its bolometric luminosity $L$ (total electromagnetic energy radiated by the star per unit time) and its photospheric radius R (radius, at which the optical depth at a given wavelength is equal to unity). This way, the definition specifies $T_{\textrm{eff}}$ through $L=4\pi \sigma R^2 T_{\textrm{eff}}^4$, where $\sigma$ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The definition clearly alludes to black-body law. Many stars, including our own Sun, have a spectrum that does not follow it. For this reason, one often talks about another effective temperature, which is the temperature of stellar material at photospheric radius, and which can be determined by examining stellar spectrum. There are a few more complications to that, but let's put them aside. Determining $T_{\textrm{eff}}$ is extremely important in characterising stars, therefore there exists a variety of methods of measuring it, and naturally researchers strive for obtaining the best possible precision. Hence, the question: How well can one in principle measure $T_{\textrm{eff}}$, if one could have arbitrarily perfect instruments? Edit: I would like to see a quantitative estimate in your answer. Is the best possible precision for $T_{\textrm{eff}}$ of order $10\textrm{K}$, or is it $1\textrm{K}$, or some $10^{-4}\textrm{K}$, or can we measure it arbitrarily well? Here are just a few sources of uncertainty/arbitrariness: convection in stars, dependence of photospheric radius on wavelength, limb darkening, stellar variability, to name a few. I would encourage the answers to be in the format ""Source of uncertainty"" - ""Simple derivation"" - ""Estimate of the effect"". If there are more than a few estimates, I will add a summary of them in the question or in a separate reply. Please, also feel free to edit the question if you might like to."|astronomy.stackexchange.com
2503254935956116338|On analogies between gas and stellar systems|Analogies between (typically) ideal gas and stellar systems are not only intuitively valid to some extent, but have been established and used in the studies of stellar clusters and galactic systems, most often as a simplification to collisionless Boltzmann equations. The idea behind the analogy is that if a stellar system can be represented as a set of point masses, and if the number of point masses is large, then we can consider them from the point of view of kinetic theory of gases. One thing to remember here, though, is that stellar gas system is neither relaxed, nor can be relaxed. I am curious here: How far can the described analogy be pushed? For example, there is a range of gas-specific phenomena (or we could be talking about plasma, if you may prefer), which would be fascinating to imagine for stellar systems, such as shocks, turbulence or viscosity. Can such, or some other, characteristic phenomena exist in stellar systems and are there actual systems exhibiting such a behavior?

139736502365663649|How does one determine the effective temperature of a star from its spectrum?|Determining effective temperature of a star is in general a non-trivial task. Simple reason for this is that we can only study the electromagnetic radiation from a star, but not the temperature directly. The complexity is due to the fact that the radiation is produced in stratified stellar atmospheres, which are only partially characterised by stellar temperature, but also by many other factors, such as stellar mass, elemental abundances, stellar rotation, etc. What is more, the temperature of atmospheres varies with depth, whereas effective temperature is just a number. From the other hand, temperatures and magnitudes are the most important quantities, characterising stars. So, the question: How exactly does one use the spectrum to extract the information about the temperature of a star? By temperature here I mean effective temperature, or even the temperature profile of the atmosphere. Note: This a rather textbook question.

It can also help to estimate a star's radius by correlating its absolute magnitude with effective temperature and apparent magnitude. In the absence of these measurements or observations of tell-tale variability, how might you guess a star's age and evolutionary status? Given a single, high-resolution $(R\gtrsim 50000)$ spectrum as your only data point, how easy is it to accurately infer the age and evolutionary status of a star? For example, how would the spectrum differ between a red dwarf and red giant, both with of $T_{\mathrm{eff}} = 4000~\mathrm{K}$? Or between two red dwarfs of ages $2~\mathrm{Gyr}$ and $8~\mathrm{Gyr}$?

3153265471839613563|How was Io not torn apart by tidal forces during its formation?|Jupiter's moon Io is arguably one of the most volcanically active bodies in the Solar System. The reason, according to NASA's page Scientists to Io: Your Volcanoes Are in the Wrong Place is believed to be caused by Io being caught in a tug-of-war between Jupiter's massive gravity and the smaller but precisely timed pulls from two neighboring moons that orbit further from Jupiter – Europa and Ganymede. Io orbits faster than these other moons, completing two orbits every time Europa finishes one, and four orbits for each one Ganymede makes. This regular timing means that Io feels the strongest gravitational pull from its neighboring moons in the same orbital location, which distorts Io's orbit into an oval shape. This in turn causes Io to flex as it moves around Jupiter. So, how did Io form in the first place, given the tidal stresses acting upon it? Does this suggest (and what evidence is there) that Io 'migrated' into its present orbit?|astronomy.stackexchange.com

EDIT: I thought I'd figured this out: On Earth, one degree of latitude is not the same as one degree of longitude (except at the equator). Analogously, in the sky, one declination degree is not the same as one right ascension degree. I thought the situation for right ascension applied to azimuth, but it doesn't.

However, I can't find a site that actually says this, and some sites seem to disagree with this. Same for it being 6am sundial time when the sun is due east. I know there are different types of sundials, but had always assumed they would give the same sundial time. Is that not true? As a note, the sundial I describe above can be fairly inaccurate at times, which makes me question whether I'm correct. EDIT (to clarify question): Forgetting entirely about clock time for a moment, suppose I build a sundial. When the sun is due west, my sundial reads 6pm. When the sun is due east, my sundial reads 6am. When the sun is due south, my sundial reads noon. My question: have I built my sundial correctly? The type of answer I'm hoping to get: No. When you build a sundial, it should read (something else) when the sun is due west. There are many different types of sundials. Depending on type, your sundial may or may not read 6pm when the sun is due west. It depends on your latitude: sundials are latitude-specific. There's no such thing as a global sundial.

In the Java documentation of Time : http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Date.html , it is said : Some computer standards are defined in terms of Greenwich mean time (GMT), which is equivalent to universal time (UT). GMT is the ""civil"" name for the standard; UT is the ""scientific"" name for the same standard. The distinction between UTC and UT is that UTC is based on an atomic clock and UT is based on astronomical observations, which for all practical purposes is an invisibly fine hair to split. Because the earth's rotation is not uniform (it slows down and speeds up in complicated ways), UT does not always flow uniformly. Leap seconds are introduced as needed into UTC so as to keep UTC within 0.9 seconds of UT1, which is a version of UT with certain corrections applied. There are other time and date systems as well; for example, the time scale used by the satellite-based global positioning system (GPS) is synchronized to UTC but is not adjusted for leap seconds.

8199782647859392112|Hypothetical trans-Neptunian planets orbiting the Sun|The planet HD 106906 b was found at 650 AU from its home star, a star not so different from the Sun. Fomalhaut b is also a young planet that is orbiting very far away from its star. These two planets were discovered mainly because they are young enough to still be hot enough to be seen in the infrared. I think that old planets in very high orbits would have temperatures below 10K, and thus be black and invisible. Some people agree with the hypothesis that, in our Solar System, somewhere out beyond Neptune, some non-dwarf planets might be orbiting the Sun. The existence of HD 106906 b and Fomalhaut b suggests that this is possible. What are the odds that we could find at least one of these planets in our Solar System?

8640329948248031970|On (minuscule) dark matter production in supernovae|It is believed that dark matter is made of particles, which interact with matter only weakly and gravitationally. One common candidate for dark matter are so called WIMPs. WIMPs, specifically, are heavy and may be their own antiparticles. And as any other particles dark matter particles can be produced at sufficiently high energies. The mass of dark matter particles is unknown, but is estimated to be of order $1$-$100 \textrm{GeV}$, which corresponds to temperatures of $T_{DM}\approx 10^{13}$-$10^{15}\textrm{K}$, at which these particles may be expected to be produced. Such enormous temperatures are barely attainable in any reasonable astrophysical processes, but say in core-collapse supernovae newly formed core has temperatures of $T_{SN,after}\approx 10^{11}\textrm{K}$, and probably more during the collapse phase. Then a crude estimate would suggest that the amount of dark matter produced is $M_{DM}\approx e^{-T_{DM}/T_{SN,max}}M_\odot$. Or, in number form $\log_{10}(M_{DM}/\textrm{kg})=30.3-0.43(T_{DM}/T_{SN})$. This means that at $T_{SN}=1.4\cdot 10^{-2}T_{DM}$ the amount of dark matter produced during a supernova will be around one kilogram. Such temperatures are fairly reachable for $1 \textrm{GeV}$ DM particles. So one can optimistically expect few kilograms of dark matter produced per supernova. Now the question. What is a typical dark matter production in core-collapse supernovae? A good answer, I imagine, would be a more robust expansion on the existing estimate. Any constructive comments are welcome.|astronomy.stackexchange.com

The Planck Telescope is already there, as was Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and other probes, and from Wikipedia I learned that: In practice, any orbit around Lagrangian points L1, L2, or L3 is dynamically unstable, meaning small departures from equilibrium grow exponentially over time. Gaia has some kind of Orbital Maneuvering System (to borrow a Space Shuttle term) and some propellant on board, so has Planck, however I wonder how deterministic these orbits are and if both Planck and Gaia have automatic corrections and collision detection in their flight computers; L2 is ""only"" 1.5 million km (or about 5 light-seconds) away so surely there's time for manual correction. Does anyone know a source which tells how different Gaia's and Planck's orbits are, if there are intersections between their orbital planes or even how likely the need for an unplanned orbital correction is?

I don't have a telescope nor camera. Yet, I'm really really curious about what it is I saw in the sky tonight. Towards, the east I first noticed a ""constellation"" the looked much like what is described to be the big dipper (It is possible that it could have been Andromeda and Pegasus). It was squarish and had somewhat of a ladle towards it's north eastern corner. The most distinguishable feature of the structure was that it had 3 stars in a straight line. It was the straightest line in the entire night sky. About a hand's length to the west was another ""constellation"", my guts said it's name was Orion. Again, I have never seen, let alone distinguished, a constellation properly in my life. It was like a triangle with it's nose pointing towards the east. The sides that converged to the nose seemed to extend a bit backwards like antennas. And to the west (a few inches north to the Orion was this strange glow. At first I thought it was my eyes playing tricks on me as sometimes whenever you stare into light bulb or some other light source, a faint glow in that area of your vision often persists. And as I looked directly at it, it slowly faded away into darkness and all that was distinguishable was an extremely tiny star or two. But whenever I looked to something near it (like a tree or constellation) , the patch reappeared. Then, I noticed that there was cluster of tiny little stars. I couldn't make out much. What caused that light patch? It seemed to glow in and out like it was breathing. I am sure that my eyes weren't playing tricks on me because even as I turned around and tilted my head and jumped up and down in the process, the patch remained in the same spot in the sky. The location which I observed this is from Ernakulam, Kerala, India. The nearest current sky map I could find is the following from Chennai (which is really far away): I can't make head or tail of it. Please help and no I'm not crazy.

The point is; The distance between me and my flashlight is constant as long as I am observing it. The photons coming from the flashlight would obviously not be rocket powered - and they would be affected by the black holes gravitation. Would the light I see from the flashlight be shifted towards red or blue, even though the distance between me and my dear flashlight is maintained? If so; switching the positions of me and my flashlight, would it change the color I'd observe? If we turn off the rocket on the flashlight, I assume it would be redshifted regardless of which were closer to the singularity, and the magnitude of redshift would appear to accelerate?|astronomy.stackexchange.com
200147599239023224|How does light affect the universe?|"When light is emitted by for example a star, that star loses energy - which causes it to reduce its gravity. Then that energy begins a journey for potentially billions of years, until it reaches some other object. When that light reaches a surface, such as another star or galaxy, it will give that energy to the destination star in the form of heat. This causes the receiver to increase its energy, in turn restoring a sort of balance. It also causes the receiver to emit a minute amount of more light again, almost like a reflection. It will also excert pressure on the receiving surface once it reaches its destination, be it a star, a rock or anything else. But while that light is travelling through space, its energy is ""unavailable"" to the rest of the universe. Naturally I ask the following question: Will light cause gravity, while it is traveling? Every single star emits light in every direction, and will eventually reach every other star in the universe. At any single point in the universe, there must be a continous ray of light coming from every single other star in the universe, that has a direct path to that point. Given that all stars on the sky is sending photons that reaches every square centimeter of the earth surface, the amount of pressure should sum up to be quite large. Is the amount of pressure really neglible, given that every single atom on any surface is receiving light from every single lightsource on the sky? Based on a calculation found at http://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qshrink.html the sun will during its lifetime emit 0.034 % of its total mass as energy. Assuming the sun is average, and that there are about 10^24 stars in the universe, and all of these stars on average are half way through their lifetime, there should be energy amounting to the gravity of about 1.7*10^22 suns distributed throughout the universe."|astronomy.stackexchange.com

1364404970892585212|Age and relativity|"This is a question, where I start with some assertions: Try to consider the universe as a four-coordinate system, x,y,z,t where t is time and where we view a change in t as a change in position, and as a velocity in the same way as any other change in either of the other components of the coordinate. Everything is then moving at the speed of c. The difference between a photon and another particle would be that a photon ""spends"" its velocity in any of the x, y or z dimensions - but not in the time dimension. This implies that all photons are on the same coordinate in the t-dimension - only the x,y,z values change while t remains 0. It also implies that time would appear to stop for something travelling in only the other dimensions, while it would pass fastest for something completely stationary. You can then also consider space-time as a function of acceleration. A physical objects' coordinate could be derived from its velocity, which would have to be derived from its acceleration. Acceleration would be a function of entropy, or ""age"" I believe. Is this the basis of general relativity? Is it at least an initial starting point for general relativity, or is it completely wrong? Would spin have to be part of the coordinate system?"|astronomy.stackexchange.com
4558252061168428905|How can the life time of a multiple star system, such as for example the trinary system PSR J0337+1715 be derived?|"As for example explained at the beginning of this blog post, the trinary system consists of a millisecond pulsar ($1.438$ times the mass of the sun) orbited by two white dwarfs. One of the white dwarfs ( $0.198$ solar masses) is very close to the pulsar and has an orbit period of $1.6$ d, whereas the other one ($0.410$ solar masses) is farther away and and needs about a year ($327$ d) to orbit the central pulsar. Such a three-body system is in principle expected to show a chaotic behavior sooner or later, which means that collisions between these three celestial bodies can be expected and a finit life time of the system can be assumed. Making some in my opinion way too hand-waving arguments, the blog post further explains that the collisions can not be expected too soon however, by taking into account that the distant white dwarf ""sees"" the inner white dwarf and the pulsar as a single central body and the relative motion of the inner white dwarf around the pulsar is rather stable and eliptic too. Thinking about such multiple star systems as chaotic dynamical systems, another approach to estimate the liftime could be to make use of some chaos-theoretic methods which could for example involve the Lyapunov Exponent of the system, such that a large exponent would mean that the collisions happen soon and the stellar system has a rather short life time, whereas the converse would be true if the Lyapunov exponent is small (which is what I would expect for the system in my question). So in short my question is: how can the liftime of a multiple star system be calculated in a not just hand-waving way?

The K/T extinction has attracted too many theories about what was 'added' to life on earth such as the comet/asteroid/Deccan Traps theories etc. No-one has looked at what might have been taken away from earth to cause the same effect!

1406847348058651549|Can we calculate the average temperature of the heliosphere?|It is my understanding that one can measure the temperature of the universe by measuring cosmic microwave background radiation. Could we also use this method for calculating the average temperature of the heliosphere? The average temperature of the universe has supposedly been measured in at 2.735 degrees above absolute zero. Presumably this measurement takes into account the massive amounts of 'empty' space which I imagine has a huge effect on the number. My question: Can we measure the average temperature of the heliosphere? If so, then what is it? This might be quite hard to define as how do you determine when our solar system ends? So for the purpose of this question the following assumptions should be made: The distance from the Sun to the edge of the heliosphere is approximately 100AU (Roughly the size of the heliosphere as measured by Voyager 1). Assume the heliosphere is a perfect sphere. Assume we are measuring the black body equivalent temperature (as this is what was measured to calculate the temperature of the universe). If we don't know how to measure this average temperature (which is likely if we can't differentiate between microwaves from in and outside the heliosphere) then how could we theoretically measure this value assuming a perfect environment?|astronomy.stackexchange.com

I am doing this as part of a kaggle competition on using machine learning to predict galaxy morphology. I have no chance of a high rank in this competition so I'm not hesitant to ask for help. I used the R contourLines function to identify the isophotes of the galaxy and then fit ellipses to each isophote. This seemed to work well, the isophotes are almost always well fit by the ellipses and the ellipses are nearly concentric. Then letting be the pixel intensity of an isophote and be the length of the semi-major axis of the corresponding ellipse, I need to fit an equation of the form  The simple approach seemed to be to take the log of both sides and use OLS regression, so I fit a linear model in R of the form  The resulting graphs showed a good fit but the resulting Sérsic indices n are almost always less than one and never as big as two. This doesn't seem right since indices of 4 or higher seem common in my reading. I don't get anywhere near 4 for an image of M87. Possibly taking log log flattens things out too much and the index is not responsive enough. I tried using nls to work with just the log but it didn't move the indices much. Is there any standard software or algorithm for computing the Sérsic index from an image? Are there reference images I can work from that would let me check if my algorithm is reasonable?

1910633645593927650|Nuetrino interaction with plasma and electromagnetism|Following question enter link description here After watching the Thunderbolt Project on Youtube I have a very very very fresh perspective on the universe - the electric universe. From the electric comet theory that pretty much proves water forms at the comet, and comets are not frozen water. In the solar wind all that hydrogen missing an electron and/or free electrons, fuse/react with oxygen-silicate elements of long orbit bodies that have been long long long holding opposite --- charges +++ inside and at the outside surfaces. When the rocky body nears a sun it gains plasma discharged from the sun, it arch's like a plasma torch, and water is formed, stealing the oxygen long held in the rock formation. A comet is an asteroid that has just had a long long long time to build up a charge. So with that and deep space showing dancing archs of electric plasma, ie space lightning, across the universe being as, or more influential as a force/energy, than gravity even, and with Einstein's admission that he was missing something in a unified theory, my question is: while neutrinos interact weekly with quote unquote solid matter, in a magnetic electrified universe are neutrinos subject to capture/interaction in Electro-magnetic currents or where voltage potential and capacitance is built up ?

It takes redshift and angular sizes (for distance) of the galaxy to determine velocity, and thus rate of expantion. But I guess the factor of direction in which the galaxy is moving may substantially affect the 'expantion rate' calculations. i.e. If the galaxy A is moving in same direction as ours, will have less relative speed and the galaxy B moving in opposite direction will have more relative speed. The actual local speed may be the same. I wonder whether this fact can be considered when we determine the expansion rate?|astronomy.stackexchange.com

2764876679795191723|Why one cannot escape from a black hole|"The usual explanation is that escape velocity of a black hole is above speed of light, therefore nothing can escape because nothing can move faster than light. This is however a fallacy, because escape velocity only pertains to bodies ""without propulsion"", or in other words without any force other than gravity acting on them. As an example I could theoretically escape Earth's gravity at a walking speed, just give me a staircase and I could walk all the way to the Moon. No need to accelerate to 11 km/s at any point. How does this affect black holes? Why cannot I have a staircase and climb out? I know the staircase idea must be wrong, but I would like to know why. My guess is that I am applying Newtonian mechanics to a problem which requires general relativity approach, because Newtonian mechanics approximation fails badly around such massive gravity fields? Anyway, according to Newtonian mechanics one can easily escape a black hole, even if we assume that speed of light cannot be exceeded."|astronomy.stackexchange.com

2690444770121338574|If the earth stopped rotating, would we really fly inertially at 1000mph?|I heard this on Prof. Neil Tyson's StarTalk podcast (this episode) and had a question about it. In a Q&A session, a listener had asked what would happen if Superman really did stop the earth from rotating and rotated it in the other direction. Prof. Tyson's response was that if the earth, which is rotating at approx. 1000mph about its axis, is stopped, everything that is not anchored on earth will move the opposite direction at 1000mph and we'd all go crashing into things at that speed. I suppose that is just simple inertia: if a body moving at 1000mph is stopped abruptly, everything that was moving with it but not attached to it would indeed attempt to continue in the same direction at 1000mph. However, the earth is rotating rather than moving in a straight line. Essentially, gravity is strong enough to ensure that we are not thrown off into space by the centrifugal force from the earth's rotation (we aren't holding on to our dear lives as the earth turns at 1000mph). So in a sense, aren't we anchored to earth by gravity? And therefore, doesn't it mean that if the earth stopped abruptly, we'd just stop with it? (I'm thinking of say a centrifuge with test tubes attached to it. Though as I think about this, I feel that we'd sway at the point of attachment instead of stand still, were the earth to stop).

1396362471274685999|Why does the darkening of the Moon go from left-to-right during an eclipse?|In anticipation of the upcoming April 2014 lunar eclipse, I decided to use the 3D virtual planetarium software Stellarium to simulate what it is supposed look like where I live, since I've never actually witnessed an actual eclipse before. I set the clock to begin at the moonrise before the beginning of the event and to tick at a rate of a few virtual-minutes per real-second, pressed play, and waited for the eclipse to begin. When it did, I saw something I did not expect. To be honest, I realized my expectations were embarrassingly naïve. I watched the Moon rise in the east and begin its upward left-to-right path across the night sky, towards its zenith in the south. My expectation was that the moment the Moon enters Earth's shadow which marks the beginning of the eclipse would be visually apparent by the darkening of the full moon's outer limb on the right side, and the darkening would progress from right to left from there. When I saw that the darkening actually progresses in the opposite direction, I immediately realized that my understanding of the geometry and kinematics of the Earth-Moon-Sun system must be much shallower than I would have thought. My main question is must lunar eclipses happen this way every time, and if so why? My gut is now telling me that it does, so I'm mostly interested in an answer of reasonable depth to the 'why' part of the question. Additionally, it occurs to me that the observation of left-to-right progression of darkening of the Moon's face during a lunar eclipse is especially counter-intuitive from the point of views of ancient geocentric cosmologies based on a stationary Earth that doesn't rotate.

My problem is that I've looked at Sirius and Mars and they look clearer to my naked eye than with my telescope. I am able to focus from way out so I can see the 'blind spot' of the secondary mirror, go through 'focused' and then continue moving the mirror in the same direction until I again see the blind spot. So I know I'm focusing through when it should be 'good'. But, like I said, what I see is a relatively unfocused spot of light that is clearer and steadier with my naked eye. Admittedly, my 'seeing conditions' aren't very good since I am looking through my window in a suburban neighborhood where light pollution is pretty bad. That being said, I still see Mars and Sirius quite brightly - it's just that they never come into clear focus - nor are they any larger than when I look using my eyes. And when I move my eye around the eyepiece I see streaks of light in different directions originating from the target. There are many stars to be seen, though they are just pinpricks as I would expect given the seeing conditions. What I mean to say is that I cannot see all those stars with my naked eye but can see tens or hundreds more looking through the scope so I know it is gathering plenty of light as an 11"" scope should. I tried both with and without the diagonal with no discernable difference. I have not collimated but supposedly it was collimated before leaving the factory and I would hope that even if it were off a bit from shipping I would still be able to see a sizable though fuzzy image of Mars instead of just a small speck of orangish light.

2282833009845894993|Why do stars become red giants?|Disclaimer: I’m not a career astronomer. I don’t own a telescope. I have no professional credentials. But I do find this stuff fascinating, and I consume all the astronomy documentaries I can. So, I’ve watched lots of documentaries describing stellar evolution. I understand that below a certain threshold, stellar death does not involve supernovae. I understand that above that threshold, supernovae may create neutron stars, magnetars, or (if the supernova qualifies as a hypernova) black holes. However, for a long time, I was curious about why stars below the supernova threshold—like our own Sun—become Red Giants. From documentaries, I have been instructed that (for stars below the supernova threshold), when the star’s core’s fusion cannot continue…fusion ceases, and the star begins to collapse under gravity. As gravity crushes the star, I understand that the star heats up as gravity crushes it. As a result, although the stellar core remains “dead” (no fusion occurs), a “shell” of gas around the stellar core becomes hot enough to begin fusing helium. Since the fusion occurs as a “shell” around the stellar core, the outward-push from the fusion is what pushes the star’s outer layers further. The result is that the star grows into a Red Giant. My question is this: Why does fusion cease in the core?! It seems to me that as gravity crushes the star, stellar fusion would reignite in the core itself—not in a sphere around the core. Why does the stellar core remain “dead” while its “shell” begins fusion???|astronomy.stackexchange.com
715758767323868187|Black dwarf binary systems|I know black dwarf stars do not exist yet, and that they are what white dwarfs end up after a long time. The question is really simple: would it be possible to have a binary system in which one of the two is a black dwarf, and the other companion star is dumping mass on the black dwarf, causing the black dwarf to supernova? I guess based on the timescales, the maximal initial mass of the second object could be calculated to see if it is possible that one object is at the black dwarf stage and the other still a giant. Or is the timescale on which the star goes from white dwarf to black dwarf big enough that it will never reach the black dwarf stage while the other one is still an AGB star? Second part: If not possible that one is black dwarf and the other AGB star, is it possible if the companion is a brown dwarf, that they are close binary, and that a brown dwarf would dump mass on a black dwarf? This would need the binary system to be a very close binary system at this stage of the system. Third part of the question: would the spectrum of the supernova be any different from the normal one with a white dwarf and a companion AGB star? I guess the spectral lines would be different, since the companion would have to be a very low-mass AGB star, since that companion would be about 20billion years or so, when the black dwarf star becomes a black dwarf.|astronomy.stackexchange.com

I also need the number of ""counts per second"" of ""nothing"" (the ""dark count"") to subtract that from the ""counts per second"" when illuminated by the star (to determine the ""counts per second"" generated by the star alone). This ""reality check"" will help me assure various ""inefficiency allowances"" I made are realistic. Examples:  As implied, I am only interested in the APD operating in ""photon counting mode"" (not analog). I've read about 5 dozen articles that discuss APDs for astronomy, but none give a straightforward value. The closest I found was a vague statement that the limited magnitude was 22nd magnitude on a 6-meter telescope based upon observations of the crab nebula pulsar. But this is not specific and the object is highly variable (on a short time frame). They did not say, for example, whether they consider their ""limiting magnitude"" is where the count rate rises from 200 per second (dark count) to 220 per second (measurement), or 200cps to 400cps, or over what time period, or any other indication of their definition. All I need is ONE clear statement of cps for any aperture and visual magnitude star. You'd think I could find that in dozens if not hundreds of articles, but... no. Probably a clear statement like I need exists in some article somewhere, but I haven't seen one. Have you? Or better yet, have you made such an observation yourself? The following detail is not very important (but just to be complete), my primary applications perform fairly high time-resolution measures on fairly bright stars. In other words, the experiments generally need to measure in the range of ""counts per microsecond"" to ""counts per millisecond"". Typically APDs max out at around 15 to 50 million counts per second, and most of my experiments will be working at 10K to 10M counts per second to observe the short time-period phenomenon I need to measure."|astronomy.stackexchange.com

I've read somewhere most probably in 'A Brief History of Time' that there is a possibility that the Universe is spherical. So is it possible that all galaxies are moving towards each other? Imagine the Universe as a sphere. Now, imagine a diameter AB. The Big Bang took place at A and the galaxies started drifting away and as they moved away further they stared attracting each other on the other side i.e.Gravitational attraction. So we feel that the farther galaxies are the faster they are moving away(Hubble's Law) but actually they are moving towards each other and will eventually meet at point B. Also, space-time is spherical and so light travels along the sphere. So, my question is: Is it possible for the universe to be spherical with galaxies apparently moving away but actually moving closer?|astronomy.stackexchange.com

3571382155740743578|Telescope in Sun's gravity lens focus - pointing, gain, distortions|"A telescope located in the gravitational focus of the Sun can use the Sun as a magnifying lens. The focus begins 550 AU away, but maybe a 700 or 1000 AU distance is needed to get rid of disturbances from the Corona, and the focus extends practically indefinately. Here are some slides by Dr. Maccone who has promoted this idea he calls FOCAL: http://www.spaceroutes.com/astrocon/AstroconVTalks/Maccone-AstroconV.pdf I intend to ask about the technical design and feasibility of such a project in the Space Exploration SE. Here I rather ask about the scientific value and challenges. POINTING: The magnification would occur only in the exact direction of the Sun. But since the Sun moves and the background objects magnified move, I suppose that the observed targets would change continuously. Would it even be practically possible to give the telescope a trajectory which keeps it aiming at for example Alpha Centauri? Would there most of the time be nothing in the right direction as the line between the telescope and the Sun sweeps across space, or would there alway be some star or galaxy in sight? Like CMB if nothing else. GAIN: In the slides linked above, Maccone has calculated the expected gain to 114 dB for infrared wavelengths. How many times ""magnification"" does this mean? I don't think I understand the units here, I get a ridiculously large number. Can it be explained somewhat intuitively? Would a FOCAL mission be a unique revolution in astronomy, or could similar results be achieved by building an interferometer with interplanetary sized baselines here nearer to the Sun? How does the science value of a gravity lens compare to that of a wide baseline? Are they good for different tasks? DISTORTIONS: Could the lensed signals be reconstructed thanks to our knowledge of the Sun and measurements of corona activity? If pointed towards a central part of the Milky Way, wouldn't signals come from multiple objects at the same time, some much further away than others? Would the gravity lens of the Sun have bigger problems with distortion than the intergalactic gravity lenses we know of today? And finally, can any natural strong lensing inside the Milky Way be used today, for example using a globular cluster as a lens?"|astronomy.stackexchange.com

1240985774687400031|Conundrum involving distance to object, universal expansion, age of universe, etc|"I was recently reading about a galaxy or quasar (not sure which, so lets just say quasar) where the estimated distance to this thing was some very significant fraction of the age of the universe. What I mean is this: I can't recall the exact particulars, but assuming for argument's sake that the age of the universe is 13.8 billion years old, this thing was like 13 billion light years away. (Again, some detail here might be slightly off; the thing might have been estimated at 12 billion light years away - so focus on the general principle I am layout out here, not any particulars). What I don't understand is this. If the thing is 13 billion light years away, then the light reaching my eyes as I look at it now took 13 billion years to get to me. Yet the age of the universe is 13.8 billion years old (again if I'm slightly wrong in some of these numbers, just accept them for now for argument's sake). It means the light must have left this object when the universe was much ""smaller"" or more compact, and things were much closer together. Which means the light should have passed my position a long time ago if I have been either ""moving"" or ""expanding"" (or some combination) away from the object at anything except some rather large percentage of the speed of light. To try to boil this down, or restate it in simpler terms: 1) either it seems I am moving/expanding/red-shifting away from this object at some significant fraction of the speed of light (haven't done the numbers, but might be 80% or 90% or so) and have been for a while, or 2) something is ""off"" (the age of the universe, or the distance of this object). or 3) there is something I'm not understanding. Which is why I came here. I have never seen it stated that we are ""expanding"" or ""redshifting"" or [insert whatever term you like] at some significant fraction of the speed of light; I have only ever seen it stated that for some brief period of time after the big bang the universe could have (or did) expand faster than light, but again that was for like less than a second if memory serves.

The gas should be absorbing photons, then re-emitting them... absorb, re-emit, absorb, re-emit... My question is where are the photons produced by re-emission? Why are there absorption lines? Although photons could be scattered, photons at other places could be scattered to our line our sight. Surely the total number of photons does not drop the further out you go? So while photons originally headed in the direction of an observer are possibly absorbed and re-emitted in a direction away from the observer, surely this will be made up for by a photon being emitted from another location in the direction of the observer? Otherwise wouldn't there be a location somewhere else where a bunch of extra scattered photons can be observed? If we integrate all the photons at the lower surface of the photosphere A and integrated all the photons at the upper surface of the chromosphere C, surely there are the same number of photons? Otherwise, where have they gone? Where is the lost energy? Are there less photons emitted from the surface C because some have been emitted back down into the Sun?

This is my first night using it and I have come across a few questions. To begin, the telescope was left alone for several years (the scope is a fairly old model) and may have become damaged over time, yet nothing too severe. We were cleaning it and got to the mirror to find that over the years the ""mirror"" cover on top of the glass had chipped away all over, giving the result of a patchy look. We were testing the scope out during the day and the image was fine - the mirror didn't affect it. Now, I am looking upon stars and have noticed a couple of things. When viewing these stars the image sort of moves, not the scope, the image. As if it were an animation, the star isn't just a white blob, it looks like the sun, where the blob is moving - as if it were a liquid. No I am not stupid enough to point the scope at the sun... during night time. The stars just move like a liquid in the center, is this an effect of the mirror? I can't see why it would be as the image was fine during daylight. Is this how all stars work? I haven't had a chance to point it at the moon or any other planets so I can't test it on an object that isn't a star. Also, as the scope is a reflector it has the ""three lines"" on the front, however this interferes with the object I am looking at as i can see the lines on the star. Is there any way to stop this, or is it just the result of using a reflector? Thanks! Image below:"|astronomy.stackexchange.com

A) Projection of life Premises: As Carl Sagan explained in his ""flatlanders"" story, we can imagine high-dimension space by making projections into space with lower dimension. As we learned at elementary school time is the fourth dimension. Question: Is it right that what we see/feel in every moment is projection of some 4D reality into our 3D world noticed by our senses. For example, If my eyes were able to ""somehow"" see in 4D and I pointed my eyes to a person, would I see that person in all stages of his/her life from birth to death as a single ""entity""? In every second we are only a projection of our 4D representation to our 3D world? B) Parallel realities Premises: If we imagine 1D space as a line without ends, 2D space as an unbounded plane and 3D space as an unbounded space, then I could put infinity number of parallel lines into 2D space and infinity number of parallel planes to the 3D space. I have read that there are at least 10 dimensions. Questions: Can I put infinite number of 3D spaces into a single 4D space? If yes, then if we for example chose geographic coordinates of Earth-Italy-Caesena as place and 49 B.C. as time coordinate, we would be probably close to event when Caesar screamed his famous: ""alea iacta est"". If we considered that 5th dimension exists and that we could put infinite number of 4D spaces into 5D space, then we would end up with infinite number of parallel realities, in which Caesar did not crossed Rubicon, or did not even exist.

It states: Orbits about Lagrangian points L4 and L5 are dynamically stable in theory so long as the ratio of the masses of the two main objects is greater than about 25, meaning the natural dynamics keep the [third object] in the vicinity of the Lagrangian point even when slightly perturbed from equilibrium. After reading it I started to wonder if there is a maximum possible amplitude (height of the peaks and troughs relative to the orbital plane of the second object) of the pattern? Also, if there theoretically is none, for cases where it is extremely large, say larger than the 2 times the radius of the second orbiting object, what would the respective object weight ratios have to be to keep such a perturbed orbit stable for any realistic period of time?

So how can we be so certain that's the limits of the zones, especially with Mars? If Mars was as large as Earth/Venus and could hold on to a thicker atmosphere and thus retain more heat, then wouldn't that automatically push out the Goldilocks Zone?

Is there really nothing at the center of a black hole? Surely, the core collapsed into something really small right? What is meant by singularity? Is it just the warping of space-time that makes it this way?|astronomy.stackexchange.com

2112231495214099040|Putting mass-luminosity relation and Hertzsprung-Russel diagrams together leads us to a mass-age relation; so how do stars lose their mass over time?|I think that the title is completely clear, but here's an expansion: I was just reading about Mass-luminosity relation that says massive stars are more luminous than tiny ones. Well, let's talk about main-sequence stars for now. This relation becomes interesting when it's mixed with the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram that says young stars are more luminous than older ones (Originally says that hotter stars are more luminous and we know that hotter stars are younger). So mixing these two relations produces some kind of Mass-age relation which says young stars are more massive, that is a star loses its mass over time, right? (Please tell me if I'm going wrong) If this Mass-age relation is right, how do stars lose this extra mass during their evolution? And where does this stray matter go?|astronomy.stackexchange.com

This is the Doppler effect. However, it was stated in response to a question I asked on a sister site that the Doppler effect would also result in the apparent frequency of a pulsar's pulses being longer or shorter due to the relative velocity of the star. Given that the speed of light is constant regardless of the frame of reference (a concept I have a really hard time understanding by the way), is this correct? My thinking is that it is incorrect. Using the analogy of a launcher lobbing medicine balls at me at a fixed rate, I can ""see"" the rate of launch by the frequency of when I get hit. However, if the launcher is moving away from me, the velocity of the balls lobbed at me will be slower (relative to my frame of reference), and thus will hit me with less frequency. However, if the launcher were to adjust its firing speed (i.e. speed of the ball relative to itself; frequency remains constant in this analogy) so that the balls always hit me at the same speed (thereby simulating the concept of the always-fixed speed of light), the time between them would not change. So, given the always-constant speed of light, is it correct that a pulsar's pulse rate would appear to be different at different relative velocities?"|astronomy.stackexchange.com

Before seeing this data, I had assumed that since the sun makes a more perpendicular path through the horizon in summer that twilight would be shorter in summer than in winter. After all, in winter the sun takes a ""slanted"" path across the horizon. Wouldn't the summer's path be more direct and therefore quicker? OK: seeing this empirical evidence I conclude that something is wrong with my premise that forms my first question. Summer twilight is longer in summer than winter. However, I still would have assumed that March 20 would have had a twilight length in between the two solstices. But it's not! Why does the equinox have the shortest twilight? Appended 5/13/2014: I didn't want to leave my original incorrect statement in here without flagging it. As Cheekhu points out below, the sun does not follow a more perpendicular path in summer than winter, as I had erroneously assumed and stated above.

8768202549414138402|"A black ""superhole"" possibility?"|When matter crosses the event horizon, it is easy to imagine that matter is torn apart into their individual components by tidal wave effects. Atoms would be ripped apart eventually. At one time, the particles will fall so deep into the gravity well, that a single particle would be touching both sides of the gravity well at the same time. At that moment, I choose to assume that the particle particle core may be spaghettified, but externally it will appear to be shrinking. Knowing that spaghettification is dependent on the size of the object, as well as the difference in gravity on both sides, a shrinking particle may eventually become so small that the steepness of the gravity well is no longer a problem. The particle continues to shrink forever. Over time, gravity between all the particles that have shrunk, will again start to take effect - and I imagine that that is what happened in the big bang. So the cosmic inflation, could just as well be particle shrinking, as a result of all particles in our universe being within the same black superhole. Taking this idea, we could look at our own universe and I guess we would expect to see certain effects such as accelerating cosmic expansion, perhaps a cosmic background radiation and we would expect our universe to end as a cold, dead place. Is this a known theory or idea, and where can I find papers on it?|astronomy.stackexchange.com
1437754897700340413|Does matter accumulate just outside the event horizon of a black hole?|"My understanding is that time slows and approaches stopping when approaching the event horizon of a black hole. I have seen this explained several places, including a brief explanation in the last paragraph under: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole#General_relativity, quoted below: Oppenheimer and his co-authors interpreted the singularity at the boundary of the Schwarzschild radius as indicating that this was the boundary of a bubble in which time stopped. This is a valid point of view for external observers, but not for infalling observers. Because of this property, the collapsed stars were called ""frozen stars"",[17] because an outside observer would see the surface of the star frozen in time at the instant where its collapse takes it inside the Schwarzschild radius. Does this mean then that no matter actually falls into a black hole (except possibly what was there at its formation)? Would this also mean matter is accumulating just outside its event horizon? As I understand it, this would be the perspective from outside the black hole. If this is the case, I wonder if we would observe a tremendous amount of matter surrounding the event horizon, but it would be extremely red shifted? Edit: I noticed an answer to a different question, especially the end portion, provides some insight here as well: https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/1009/1386 Edit: These YouTube videos someone put together explain the concept very well, and seem to indicate this idea is gaining traction! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZvgeAbrjgc&list=PL57CC037B74307650&index=118 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1s7omTe1HI"|astronomy.stackexchange.com

However both these values strike me as very anthropocentric and, more importantly, unreliable over time as I understand that the Earth wobbles a bit over time so the celestial equator shifts and I guess Sun's rotation around the galaxy and Milky Way's own trajectory should play a role in depreciating the accuracy of those values over time. So my questions are: [1] how steady are right ascension and declination values for distant stars over time? [2] is there a more stable coordinate system or do we lack an absolutely fixed frame of reference?|astronomy.stackexchange.com

6206461272654913646|Do we make predictions in our time, or local time?|I was scrolling idly through the Wikipedia article on Orion when I read: Orion will still be recognizable long after most of the other constellations—composed of relatively nearby stars—have distorted into new configurations, with the exception of a few of its stars eventually exploding as supernovae, for example Betelgeuse, which is predicted to explode sometime in the next million years. Given that Betelgeuse is only 640 light-years away from Earth, the question of whether we're talking about Betelgeuse going supernova in the next million years, or about news of the supernova reaching us in the next million years, is irrelevant, since 640 years is hardly noticeable when you're talking about ten thousand centuries. But what about a star further away? Say, something in the Andromeda Galaxy, 2.5 million light-years from us? If I read an article stating that a star in the Andromeda Galaxy was going nova in a million years, would that mean: a) That we think the star will go nova one million years from now, and its light will reach us in 3.5 million years; or b) That we believe the star went nova 1.5 million years ago, and its light will reach us in one million years In other words, are we making estimates in our time, or in celestial-body-local time?|astronomy.stackexchange.com

6572157002049235393|Meaningful theories of the shape of the universe|"Normally, when people say ""the universe is infinite"" they generally mean something like ""the observable universe is locally flat, it is easy to assume that it is flat way beyond the observable universe, I don't know what lies beyond that, I won't talk about that, that is enough for practical purposes"" (or any other proposition implying infinity in any direction and assumed for simplicity's sake while actually focussing on a small region of the space, the observable universe). So, ""the universe is infinite"" does not seriously mean that physical space goes on forever because this simply makes no sense at all, ""infinite"" is not a number, it is not a magnitude, it is not a property of real things (if you disagree with this premise please explain how the notion of infinity can be seriously applied to any direction of physical space, i.e. how you can seriously think to extend, sic et simpliciter, such a property of your mathematical model to the real world). (Personally I don't think this should be counted as a theory of the shape of the universe at all). On the contrary, ""the universe is finite and unbounded, compact, closed in all directions"" is indeed a meaningful and in principle acceptable theory because it can be thought, described, discussed for what it actually implies. Of course, we don't know what lies beyond the observable universe but the idea of a compact universe makes sense and it seems to me this is the only meaningful explanation currently available of what ""could"" be (it is not necessarily the right, true explanation, of course). Is there any other meaningful alternative (which can be thought, described, discussed)? Is there any alternative to the dichotomy ""finite universe"" vs ""infinite universe""? Is there anybody out there working on models that overcome this dichotomy?"|astronomy.stackexchange.com
